# Computer engineering 
<sub> Developer Frontend & Backend </sub>

<p>Hello everyone, ¿what's going on?. I am a developer with 1+ year of experience developing web applications, </br>
lover of backend development, I would like to say the same with frontend but it's not my forte. Here I am trying to acquire new skills and </br>
apply in my current day, I hope soon to show my skills to the world and skills and shut it up.
